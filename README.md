# Julia-Sets
A Julia set can be defined to be the set of initial conditions ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_0) which produce a bounded sequence ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={z_n}) when the recurrence relation

zn+1 = f(z) = z2 n + c
